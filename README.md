# Workshop on Machine Learning on HPC Systems (MLHPCS)

## Date: in conjuction with the ISC 2020 (June 21st - 25th 2020)

## Abstract
Over the last few years, Machine Learning/Deep Learning (ML/DL) has become an important research topic in the High Performance Computing (HPC) community. Bringing new users and data intensive applications on HPC systems, Machine Learning is increasingly affecting the design and operation of compute infrastructures. On the other hand, the Machine Learning community is just getting started to utilize the performance of HPC, leaving many opportunities for better parallelization and scalability. The intent of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss three key topics in the context of High Performance Computing and Machine Learning/Deep Learning: parallelization and scaling of ML/DL algorithms, HPC system design and optimization for ML/DL workloads and ML/DL applications on HPC systems.  

## Topics / Scope
The aim of the workshop is to provide a platform for technical discussions, work in progress and the presentation of unsolved problems, which is complementary to the “Machine Learning Day” in the main conference program.

* Unsolved problems in ML/DL on HPC systems
* Scalable Machine Learning / Deep Learning  algorithms
* Parallelization techniques 
* Libraries for ML/DL
* Tools + workflows for ML/DL on HPC systems
* Optimized HPS System design / setup for efficient ML/DL 
* ML Applications on HPC Systems
