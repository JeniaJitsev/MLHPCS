## Abstract
The developments in the last years have shown the necessity to bring the research areas HPC, Big Data, and Machine Learning closer together. Often, this was simply driven by the curiosity and visions of researchers. However, it also happened that people are working on related problems, but do not know of each other.
In order to support this moving together of the HPC, the Big Data, and the Machine Learning research communities, there are many different initiatives all over the world.
In my talk, I want to give you an impression of the activities at the Technical University Dresden in common with the University of Leipzig to push on the interchange between the research areas, enlarge the sight on common research problems, and support the interlocking between methodological and applicational research fields. A selection of ongoing Machine Learning projects are presented, which are undertaken in this scientific environments and benefit from the close integration of the HPC infrastructure, the application science, and the methodolgical expertise.
